# Hi there 👋

I’m **Vinodh Kumar Rajkumar** – a Systems Engineer (INCOSE ASEP) with an MSc in Astronautics & Space Engineering from Cranfield University. I'm passionate about solving complex engineering problems at the intersection of aerospace, systems engineering, and software.

### 🔭 My Focus

My primary focus is on developing robust, reliable, and well-documented engineering systems. I am particularly interested in the application of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and software automation to improve the quality and efficiency of the entire product lifecycle.

### 🚀 Highlighted Project

* **[ReqCheck - Automated Requirements Analysis Tool][1]**
    * A self-directed project I am building in Python to proactively identify risks in the product development lifecycle. The tool parses engineering requirements documents to flag ambiguities, weak language, and passive voice, helping to prevent costly rework. It is a practical application of combining systems thinking with software to solve a real-world engineering problem.
